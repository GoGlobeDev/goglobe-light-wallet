		mnemonic:
			'Mnemonic is another form of plain text private keys. It was first come up with in BIP 39 proposal. Its purpose is to help the users to memorize the complicated private keys (64 digits of hash value). Mnemonic usually consists of 12, 15, 18, 21 words. These words are from a fixed pool of vocabulary. The order of the words is generated according to certain algorithm. So there’s no need for the users to worry that an address of wallet would be generated by randomly entering 12 words. Although mnemonic and keystore can both be used as plain text form, compared to keystore, mnemonic is unencrypted private keys with no guarantee of security. Anyone who accidentally acquires your mnemonic can take away your asset effortlessly. So when backing up the mnemonic, the users should keep the following three in mind: 1. It’s the best to use physical backup device, such as writing down on the paper. Try not to use screen shots or take photos and put them in the online device in order to prevent the data from being acquired by the hackers. 2. Verify mnemonic multiple times to ensure the correctness of the backup. The misrecord of one or two words, will bring great difficulty to restoring mnemonic. 3. Keep the backup of mnemonic properly to prevent it from being lost or stolen.',
		mnemonic_ps:
			'PS: Users can use the backup of mnemonic to import imToken, and then generate a new Keystore with new password.',
		keystore:
			'The Keystore is a text file (JSON) that stores the private key of encrypted digital wallet. It uses user-defined password encryption to provide a degree of protection, and the degree of protection depends on the strength of the password the user encrypts the wallet. Password such as 123456, is extremely insecure. There are two things to keep in mind when using Keystore: 1. Encrypt keystore files with passwords that are not commonly used and as complex as possible. 2. Be sure to remember the keystore password. Once you forget your password, you lose access to the keystore, and TrueChain wallet can not help you retrieve the password, so be sure to keep the Keystore and password. Here is the style of the keystore:{ "version": 3, "id": "b7467fcb-3c8b-41be-bccf-73d43a08c1b7", "address": "540f18196da5a533fa36577a81de55f0a2f4e751", "Crypto": { "ciphertext": "78ed11b8b6bf29b00f52b42b8542df0e4a6ac078e626af7edcf885c3b68154a4", "cipherparams": { "iv": "4516579601d96695fe30ace985a9066f" }, "cipher": "aes-128-ctr", "kdf": "scrypt", "kdfparams": { "dklen": 32, "salt": "6276cfda7d40872352c801db5871e5a3368a8d0994cea39ed936760db78d1cdc", "n": 1024, "r": 8, "p": 1 }, "mac": "d889a5dc609c3f312a41394cc47640676d2612501a6f8c837ed55598158336db" } }。',
		keystore_ps:
			' PS: The keystore password is unique and cannot be changed. If you want to change the wallet password, you need to re-import the wallet using the mnemonic or plain text private key, and use the new password to encrypt, to generate a new Keystore.',
		privateKey:
			"We often say that your control of asset in your wallet depends on the ownership and control of the corresponding private key. In blockchain transactions, the private key is used to generate the  necessary signature to pay the currency to prove the ownership of the funds. The private key must always be kept confidential, because once leaked to a third party, the equivalent of the assets under the protection of the private key also surrendered. It is different from Keystore, which is an encrypted private key file. As long as the password strength is strong enough, even if the hackers get the Keystore, the cracking is difficult. The private key is not actually stored in the network, but is generated by the user and stored in a file or a simple database called a wallet. The private key stored in the user's wallet is completely independent and can be generated and managed by the user's wallet software without blockchain or network connection. The user's wallet address is generated by the private key using elliptic curve encryption to generate a public key, which in turn generates a 42-bit address starting with 0x.The private key is styled as a 64 - bit hexadecimal hash string, for example: 56f759ece75f0ab1b783893cbe390288978d4d 4ff24dd233245b4285fcc31cf6。",

			'PS: The user can use the plaintext private key to import True Chain Wallet, generate a new Keystore with a new password (remember to delete the old Keystore), and use this method to modify the wallet password.'
